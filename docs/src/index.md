# AlgorithmsCollection

A collection of classical algorithms re-implemented in `JULIA`.

!!! note
    The `ClassicAlgorithmsCollections.jl` is initially inspired by [Geeksforgeeks' Top-10-Algorithms-in-Interview-Questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-algorithms-in-interview-questions/) and should be continuously expanded by new algorithms or more elegant implementations.
